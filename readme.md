# Todo

* Need to start using Typescript in this project as it's getting difficult managing all this undocumented non-typed JS code. I also want to start using Deno as they support typescript without config which sounds nice.
* Axe the shelby lanauge and just focus on parsing. Shelby will just be a parsing lib.
* To prove shelby can parse, get it to parse Json or ECMAscript 5
