* Shelby 

Shelby is a programming language built for fun with no parsing library (pure javascript). The language is intended to transpile to both python and javascript, so the same code can run in the browser or locally on a machine. This language is not intended for production.

Warning: As of writing, compilation does not work. The project is still in heavy development.  

Below is some basic syntax. A lot of stylistic choices were borrowed from python, lua and javascript. 

```js 
    :name "Liam" 
    :age 25 

    if age >= 20 then 
        print(":name is old")
    else 
        print(":age is young!")
    end 
```
